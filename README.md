# HornetQ AS7 EAP Branch


This branch only contains extra commits required by the EAP Production team to build EAP. It basically has a few version changes on poms and master, and it will always be rebased by the EAP Production team.


As a general rule this branch will always be rebased of Branch_2_2_AS7 (git pull --rebase upstream Branch_2_2_AS7). Please avoid cherry-picking on this branch!
